<chapter id="ch07"><title>The v5dimport Utility</title>
<para>
The v5dimport utility is a program for converting grid files to v5d 
format, combining multiple source files, resampling to new coordinate 
systems and culling variables and timesteps.  It has both a graphical 
and command line user interface.
</para>
<para>
For example, you may use v5dimport to read 2 McIDAS GR3D files and a 2-D
McIDAS GRID file, resample all the data to a Lambert Conformal 
projection, omit the CWAT and VORT variables and then write the data to 
a Vis5D file called <filename>lambert1.v5d</filename>.
</para>
<para>
The basic order of events when using v5dimport is:
<orderedlist>
<listitem><para>
       Read the input file(s).
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Select grids for output according to timestep, physical variable, map
projection or vertical coordinate system.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Setup a map projection and vertical coordinate system for the output
file.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Write the output file.  Resampling is done at this time.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>
Optionally, start Vis5D on the output file.
</para></listitem>
</orderedlist>
</para>
<para>
Currently, v5dimport can read the following file formats:

<title>Using v5dimport's graphical interface</title>
<para>
Start v5dimport from your shell with
</para>

<title>Reading input grids</title>
<para>
 You may read additional grid files into v5dimport at any time by clicking
 on the "Read file..." button.  Use the file selector to locate your 
 file and click on OK or CANCEL.  It's best to read all input files 
 right at the beginning because whenever a new file is read all grids 
 are selected for output, overriding any selections you may have 
 previously made.
</para>
<para>
 The button labeled "Discard all grids" does exactly what it says.  It's
 equivalent to exiting v5dimport and restarting it.
</para>
<para>
 After reading each input file, the list of grids shown in the top half of
 the window, will be resorted by time then variable name.

<title>Selecting grids for output</title>
<para>
 It's often the case that one wants to discard some physical variables or
 timesteps from the input file so they aren't written to the output file.
 By default, all variables are selected for output.
</para>
<para>
 To select/cull variables, click on the "Select by variable..." button.  
 A pop-up window will appear which lists all the variables.  
 The ones that are highlighted are selected for ouput.  
 Click on variables names to select or deselect them.
</para>
<para>
 Similarly, you can select timesteps via the "Select by time..." button.
 A pop-up window listing all time steps will appear.  
 Use the mouse to select the time steps you want and unselect the 
 timesteps you wish to omit.  Note that you can select/deselect a number 
 of timsteps by just dragging the mouse while holding down the button.
</para>
<para>
 Finally, grids may be selected or discarded according to their map
 projection or vertical coordinate system (VCS) via the "Select by
 projectiion..." and "Select by VCS... buttons.
</para>
<para>
 Note that as you select/deselect timesteps, variables, projections, 
 or VCSs the effected grids will be high-lighted/unhigh-lighted in 
 the main grid list.
</para>
<para>
 The "Select All" and "Select None" buttons do just what they imply.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="ch07sec1.3">
<title>Defining the output file</title>
<para>
 The default parameters for the output file (grid size, projection, etc) 
 are taken from the first file read in.  
 You should always review these parameters before making your output 
 file. It will often be necessary to change these values.
</para>
<para>
 The number of rows, columns, and levels for the output file is 
 specified by the type-in fields on the main window labeld "Rows", 
 "Columns" and "Max Levels". Type in new values if the defaults are 
 incorrect.
</para>
<para>
 The map projection for the output file can be viewed and changed by
 clicking on the "Map projection..." button.  In this pop-up window 
 you'll be able to choose a map projection type then enter the 
 specific projection parameters.  There is also a "Guess" button 
 which will attempt to find a reasonable output projection given the 
 currently selected grid list.  It's often helpful to have the 
 "Select by Projection" pop-up window on-screen to compare the output 
 projection to the input projections.
</para>
<para>
 The vertical coordinate system for the output file can be viewed and
 changed by clicking on the "Vertical Coord System..." button.  
 In this pop-up window you'll be able to choose a vertical coordinate 
 system type and enter the specific parameters.  This window also has 
 a "Guess" button to try to find a reasonable default.  
 Similarly, it's often helpful to have the "Select by VCS" pop-up window 
 on-screen to compare the output VCS to the input VCSs.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="ch07sec1.4">
<title>Making the output file</title>
<para>
 Enter a filename for the output file in the type-in field at the 
 bottom of the main window then click on "Make".  
 Messages will be printed as the file conversion takes place.  
 If there are any errors the process will halt.  Note that generating 
 the output file can be time-consuming if data must be resampled
 from the input grid's coordinate system to a new coordinate system 
 for the output file.
</para>
<para>
     If you click on "Visualize" this will make the file and then automatically
start up Vis5D on that file (i.e., you don't need to click on "Make" first).  If
you type a filename in the type-in field, it wil use that name.  Otherwise, it
will use your login name followed by ".v5d".  If you want command line options
on the Vis5D command, put them in a file named 
<filename>vis5d_options</filename>.  For example, <parameter>-mbs 64</parameter>.
</para>
</sect2>
<sect2 id="ch07sec1.5">
<title>Miscellaneous</title>
<para>
An options window is available by clicking on the "Options..." button.
</para>
<para>
     The first item controls the "combining of co-located data".  It may be the
case that several 3-D grids, selected for output, are co-located in space and
time.  When computing the value to put in the output file you can either choose
the data value from the higher resolution grid at that location, or take the
average of all grid values at that grid location.
</para>
<para>
     The second item controls how grid data is compressed in the output file.
By default, grid values are scaled down to 1-byte integers.  Alternately, you
can scale down to 2-byte integers for better resolution, or perform no
compression/scaling by selecting 4-byte floating point values.  This option
respresents a tradeoff in file size and precision.

<title>The v5dimport User Interface Embedded in Vis5D</title>
<para>
     In Vis5d version 5.2 v5dimport has been incorporated into the main control
panel and is invoked by pressing the 'IMPORT' button.  This version of v5dimport
is the same as the one mentioned above except that you can load the newly
created v5d file without exiting from the program.  When the 'Make' button is
pressed it will create the file and name it using the field 'File name:'.  If
there is a name in the field 'Context name:' the file will be loaded into Vis5d
and attached to the first display.  A number must also be entered into the 'MBS'
field to specify the amout of memory to allocate for the data set.  A filename
must always be entered to use for disk backup for caching grids.
</para>
</sect1>
<sect1 id="ch07sec3">
<title>Using v5dimport's text interface</title>
<para>
     The text/type-in interface to v5dimport is useful when X is not availableor
when you want to run v5dimport with a script.  To start v5dimport in text mode
enter:
</para>
<para>
<command>
     v5dimport -t [-path pathname] [files]
</command>
</para>
<para>
where [<parameter>files</parameter>] is an optional list of input files and 
[<parameter>-path pathname</parameter>] specifies
that the directory named "pathname" is to be used as the default, in place of
the current directory, for the input file browser and for making output files.
Through the text interface it's possible to run v5dimport with a script by using
your shell's import redirection feature:
</para>
<para>
<command>
     v5dimport -t < script
</command>
</para>
<para>
After you've invoked v5dimport with the -t option you'll see a >> prompt at
which you can issue any of these commands:

<para>
A v5dimport script is simply an ASCII file of v5dimport commands and their
arguments.  In the simplest case it may contain only a few commands such as:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
     # read my file, omit two vars, write v5d file
     read mydata.dat
     omit var CW
     omit var RW
     make outdata.v5d
     exit
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>     
As v5dimport executes a script it prints each command and its result.  Lines
which start with a # are considered comments and ignored.

<title>Adding support for new file format</title>
<para>
     v5dimport was written so that adding code to read new file formats should
be easy.  The source code for v5dimport is in the import/ subdirectory.  Look
for the comment 
</para>

     Basically, you need to write two new functions.  One which scans your file
format to build a list of grid_info structs.  The other reads the actual grid
data from your file given a grid_info struct.  These functions should be put in
a new file named <filename>read_foo.c</filename> 
where foo is the name of your file format.  Then, update the 
<filename>file.c</filename> file to use your functions.  
Use the existing <filename>read_*.c</filename> files as a guide.

which can read EPA files.  Currently, only Cray systems can read EPA files
because the EPA-provided file reading functions only work on Cray computers.
