	* configure.in:
	update version number and autoconf syntax in configure.in

	* configure.in: comments

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gtk/Makefile.am, gtk/PD_interface.c, gtk/PD_interface.h, gtk/VGC_interface.c, gtk/VGC_interface.h, gtk/gradients/Makefile.am, gtk/gradients/gradient.c, gtk/interface.c, gtk/interface.h, gtk/main.c, gtk/support.c, gtk/support.h, gtk/tp_interface.c, gtk/tp_interface.h, gtk/w3D_interface.c, gtk/w3D_interface.h, gtk/window3D.c, src/main.c, src/v5dimport.c:
	gtk now builds again, sans internationalization for now, although vis5dgtk crashes if I try to run it; remove Glade-generated source code from CVS in favor of generating it in the Makefile for maintainer-mode (generated code is still included in the distributed tarball by 'make dist')

	* Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, acx_pthread.m4, configure.in, m4/acx_pthread.m4, m4/ax_check_compiler_flags.m4, src/Makefile.am:
	put autoconf macros in m4/ subdirectory, update to latest acx_pthread, get rid of crufty old code to choose compiler flags and just pick -O3

	* doc/Makefile.am, doc/chap2.sgml, doc/chap3.sgml, doc/chap4.sgml, doc/chap6.sgml, doc/chap7.sgml, doc/vis5d.sgml:
	documentation had bitrotted - fix so that it compiles again with latest Jade tools, which nowadays require XML rather than SGML format

	* src/tclheader.h.in: added missing file from last comit, whoops

	* src/save.c, src/save.h, src/script.c, src/sounding.c, src/sounding.h, src/tclsave.c, src/tclsave.h, src/user_data.c, src/user_data.h, configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/api.c, src/api.h, src/compute.c, src/compute.h, src/g.pex.c, src/graphics.gl.c, src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/graphics.pex.c, src/graphics.scenes.c, src/graphics.scenes.h, src/graphics.vrml.c, src/graphics.vrml.h, src/grid.c, src/grid.h, src/gui.c, src/igrid.c:
	fixed Tcl library detection (the library/header name these days is version-dependent it seems, grrr); numerous const-correctness fixes to eliminate compiler warnings

2006-12-01  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* configure.in, src/main.c, src/render.c:
	fix bug introduced by NCAR stereo stuff that had stopped the REVERSE button from working; also make default window size more sensible

	* Makefile.am, acinclude.m4, autogen.sh, configure.in, lui5/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, util/Makefile.am:
	fixes so that it builds again; comment out GTK+ stuff in the build, since it is currently broken and needs someone who understand GTK+ to fix it

2002-04-17  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, ChangeLog:
	This commit undoes changes made by using gettext-0.11.1 this version seems to
	automagically changes things a little too much.  I have returned to
	gettext-0.10.40 and things seem okay now.

2002-04-17  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* configure.in:
	check for xmesa.h before using XMesaGetBackBuffer (the header file is missing on Debian/testing...perhaps this functn is being deprecated as Mesa moves into XFree86?)

2002-04-11  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* ChangeLog, Makefile.am, configure.in, gtk/procedure.c, po/es.po, po/pt_BR.po, po/vis5d+.pot, src/api.c, src/api.h, src/box.c, src/globals.h, src/grid.c, src/main.c, src/proj.c, src/render.c, src/script.c, src/slice.c, src/traj.c, src/v5d.c, src/v5d.h, src/v5df.h, src/vis5d.h, src/work.c, util/v5dedit.c:
	This commit includes bug fixes in src/work.c and gtk/procedure.c, it
	also includes a new projection for unequally spaced horizontal non dimensional
	data.

	This is from Zhang Lin-bo <zlb@lsec.cc.ac.cn> :

	  The new projection takes the number -1 (I have chosen
	  this number in order to avoid possible conflicts with
	  official new projections) and is defined as a Generic
	  Nonequally Spaced Projection, and uses the following
	  entries of ProjArgs:

		ProjArgs[1]       = coordinate of Latitude[0]
		... ...
		ProjArgs[n]       = coordinate of Latitude[n]
		... ...
		ProjArgs[Nrows]   = coordinate of Longitude[0]
		... ...
		ProjArgs[Nrows+n] = coordinate of Longitude[n]

2002-03-11  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* doc/chap3.sgml: updated URL

2001-12-18  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* configure.in, src/render.c:
	changed default MBS value to 0 which causes vis5d to default to using malloc
	and free for memory allocation.  Added code to render.c that will print multiple
	clocks to the display when associated data sets times do not match the display time.

2001-12-17  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* gtk/ProcedureDialog.c:
	gtk update - irregular data now available through procedures menu

2001-12-13  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* gtk/ProcedureDialog.c, gtk/VGC_interface.c, gtk/VarGraphicsControls.c, gtk/graph_labels.c, gtk/procedure.c, gtk/support_cb.h, gtk/textplot.c, gtk/textplot.h, gtk/textplotdialog.glade, gtk/tp_interface.c, gtk/vargraphicscontrols.glade:
	continuing development of gtk interface

2001-12-05  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* gtk/gradients/gradient.c, gtk/main.c:
	the gradient files were not being read properly when locale was set to
	pt_BR , it turns out that we must set LC_NUMERIC to C so that numbers in text files are correctly read.

	* gtk/VarGraphicsControls.c, gtk/support_cb.c, gtk/textplot.c:
	continuing development

	* src/api.c, src/render.c, src/vis5d.h:
	Moved the macros for HAVE_LIBNETCDF inside of the api calls so that
	api functions are visable regardless of the presence of NETCDF, if the
	LIBNETCDF is not visable, an error message is printed.

	Changed the default memory allocation method to use system functions
	alloc and free rather than vis5d's own memory management.  MBS 0

2001-12-04  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/api.c, src/api.h:
	added a new api function which converts vis5d date/time stamp into
	ctime (the number of seconds since 1970)

	time_t vis5d_time2ctime(int daystamp, int timestamp)

2001-12-01  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* gtk/support_cb.c, gtk/textplot.c, gtk/textplot.h, gtk/textplotdialog.glade, gtk/tp_interface.c, gtk/window3D.c:
	added callbacks for textplotdialog options (incomplete)

2001-11-24  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* gtk/window3D.c:
	fix linkage when netcdf not available (i.e. no irregular data)

2001-11-23  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* configure.in: some minor reformatting

2001-11-23  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/grid.c:
	bug fix:  variable structure was not being allocated when creating a new
	variable from a type in expression.

	* src/grid.c:
	there was a bug in allocate_computed_variable, the variable structure
	must now be allocated.

2001-11-22  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* gtk/Makefile.am, gtk/textplot.c, gtk/textplot.h, gtk/textplotdialog.glade, gtk/tp_interface.c, gtk/tp_interface.h, gtk/window3D.c, gtk/window3D.h:
	Textplot (irregular data) interface added.

2001-11-21  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* gtk/support_cb.c, gtk/w3D_interface.c, gtk/window3D.c, gtk/window3D.glade, gtk/window3D.h:
	Now displays irregular data.

	* src/work.c:
	fixes a bug recently introduced which prevented itx data from
	being plotted in the absence of a ctx.

2001-11-12  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* Makefile.am, gtk/Makefile.am, gtk/gradients/Makefile.am, gtk/vis5dgtk.pc.in, po/ChangeLog:
	Fixed some ommisions in the pkg-config file.

	Renamed gtk executables and libraries and added them to the list of installed files.  Installs as vis5dgtk, (I wanted vis5d+gtk but automake doesn't like the +)

	Added *.glade files to the distribution.

	Added install target for pkg-config files.

2001-11-09  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* src/graphics.ogl.c:
	fix missing prototype, reported by Michael Boettinger

	* src/gui.c: fix whoops in last commit

	* src/graphics.ogl.c, src/gui.c:
	fix missing prototype, reported by Michael Boettinger

	* gtk/vis5dgtk.pc.in, vis5d+.pc.in:
	used canonical capitalization of Vis5d

2001-11-09  boote  <boote@ab-initio>

	* configure.in:
	libpng.a will not work without libz.a - so I added this check to autoconf...

	Ok, now I've had to go and figure out an autoconf macro... I guess I'm
	sucked into this autoconf/libtool stuff now. :)

	jeff

2001-11-08  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* src/pngdump.c: delete whitespace

	* src/pngdump.c: fixed comment

2001-11-08  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gtk/Makefile.am, gtk/vis5dgtk.pc.in, po/ChangeLog, vis5d+.pc.in:
	This commit adds support for the pkg-config tool.  This can be used
	to retreve the necessary compile flags for a program which wants to
	link with vis5d+.  For example on my machine

	$ pkg-config vis5d+ --modversion --cflags --libs
	1.3.1
	-g -Wall -I/usr/local/include/vis5d+ -I/usr/X11R6/include   -L/usr/local/lib -L/usr/local/mixkit/lib -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lvis5d -lv5d -lmix -lpng -lm -lnetcdf -ltcl -ldl -lGLU -lGL -lSM -lICE -lXext -lX11

	* src/graphics.ogl.c, README, gtk/gradients/Makefile.am, po/ChangeLog, src/api.c:
	merged from the 1.2.1 bug fix release.

	* src/pngdump.c: clarified comment

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/api.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/gui.c, src/gui.h, src/pngdump.c, src/pngdump.h, src/script.c:
	added native PNG output

	* po/ChangeLog: remove

	* gtk/support_cb.c: irregular datasets require netcdf

	* gtk/gradients/gradient.c: need gradientP.h for gradient_clist_insert

2001-11-07  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/graphics.ogl.c, src/api.c:
	bug fixes:  swap_3d_window was failing when rendering offscreen, removing the
	swap command seems to work and offscreen is not double buffered anyway is it?

	offscreen rendering was forcing ppm output.  It now allows all available formats

2001-11-06  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* README: added some notes specific to the gtk interface.

	* po/ChangeLog, po/es.po, po/pt_BR.po, po/vis5d+.pot, src/graphics.ogl.c, configure.in, gtk/gradients/Makefile.am:
	toggled version to 1.2.1 in configure.in
	corrected the gtk/gradients Makefile.in so that include files are in the distribution
	SGI/Linux opengl was crashing in set_opengl_font call to glXMakeCurrent, which
	probably didn't need to be called anyway.

2001-11-05  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/volume.c, src/work.c, configure.in, gtk/HSliceControls.c, gtk/HSliceControls.h, gtk/VarGraphicsControls.c, gtk/support_cb.c, gtk/support_cb.h, gtk/window3D.c, po/ChangeLog, src/api.c, src/api.h, src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/gui.c, src/main.c, src/render.c, src/sgidump.c:
	merged in the bug fixes made for the 1.2.0 release.
	Changed the version number in configure.in to indicate a development
	version.
	Continuing gtk development.

2001-11-01  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* gtk/gradients/gradient.c:
	added missing header; otherwise compilation fails with gcc 2.95.4

2001-10-31  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* po/ChangeLog, src/api.c, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/gui.c, src/volume.c:
	It appears that some GL libraries crash if you call some GL calls before setting glXMakeCurrent.  I´ve moved all
	references to GL out of make_big_window and into make_3d_window.  Much of the code having to do with setting the
	lighting options was duplicated anyway.  The question is whether there was a rational reason for it to be duplicated or
	if this was another case of cut-and-paste madness. :-)

	I´ve also fixed a problem I found with volume rendering - volume rendering required some mouse action in the
	window before it would draw and didn´t draw while mouse was moving.

	* src/main.c:
	only look for irregular data if we have the netcdf library required to
	read it.

2001-10-31  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* src/main.c: only call irregular i/o when HAVE_LIBNETCDF

2001-10-30  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/sgidump.c, configure.in, po/ChangeLog, src/api.c, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/gui.c, src/main.c:
	fixed a bug in main.c call to open irregular data.  modified save pic code
	so that sgi rgb format is only used on bigendian machines.  modified configure.in to locate the ImageMagic convert program - this means that convert must be
	available at configure time or vis5d will not use it.

2001-10-23  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/file.c, src/iapi.c, src/irregular_v5d.c, src/main.c, src/record.c:
	It is now allowed that irregular data files can be introduced on the
	command line in the same manor as v5d files.  Currently only one irregular
	data file can be introduced in this manner.

	* src/gui.c:
	fixed a bug introduced with the volume off during motion feature.  The index
	to enable_graphics should have been the ctx, I was sending ctx which works
	until more than one ctx or dtx is introduced.

2001-10-19  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/gui.c:
	bug fix:  If stereo is not enabled stereoBUTTON is null and it's structure
	cannot be accessed.

	I also removed a memset which was done directly after a calloc of the same
	structure.

2001-10-17  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* configure.in: cannot test equality with empty string

2001-10-16  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	modified to use make variables rather than automake/conf substitutions
	for libraries.  This makes it easier to modify makefiles for tests in
	which one does not want to reconfigure.

2001-10-11  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* ChangeLog: updated

	* ChangeLog, configure.in: some minor cleanups

2001-10-11  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	removed the USE_GLLISTS code which had several problems including disabling
	vrml output and making it hard to update color and other image attributes.

2001-10-10  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* configure.in, gtk/Makefile.am, gtk/gradients/Makefile.am, po/ChangeLog, src/main.c:
	configure.in changed to not support NLS without libintl.h
	include paths in gtk and gtk/gradients changed

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, gtk/Makefile.am, po/ChangeLog, po/es.po, po/pt_BR.po, po/vis5d+.pot, src/Makefile.am, src/graphics.vrml.c, src/memory.c, src/sounding.c:
	port to sgi indicated an error in sounding.c
	debug macro should not be defined in memory.c
	corrected gnu_gettext macro in configure.in
	corrected subdirectory structure in Makefile.am ...

	this commit should be release ready...

	This is a merge of the contributions provided by NCAR.  It includes support
	for stereo display, vrml output, and desimated isosurface calculation.

	Copyrights on some source files were changed in accordance with the following
	correspondence from Don Middleton of NCAR:

	> First, regarding the UCAR Copyright notices in Vis5D, mea culpa - they
	> should not be there. As I understand it, any enhanced or extended version of
	> Vis5D that we or anyone else create is bound by the GPL. The Copyright
	> notice is a by-product of a script we use for local software development
	> called "comment" and it jams in the notice. My fault. Please consider this
	> explicit permission from UCAR to strip those notices out.

	i got afraid to check things in for a while so ie made lots of changes.  Most recently ive started to connect the procedure dialog.

2001-09-05  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/graphics.ogl.c, src/render.c, src/work.c:
	yet another bug fixed.  This one occured only when using USE_SYSTEM_FONTS
	but not USE_GLLISTS.

	* src/misc.c: intialized linewidth for isoline requests

	* src/api.c, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/misc.c, src/queue.c, src/render.c, src/work.c:
	fixed a minor bug in selecting min and max contour values for shaded contours
	fixed an error in compiling when USE_GLLISTS is not defined.

2001-09-03  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/api.c, src/api.h, src/globals.h, src/render.c:
	added support for linewidth of HSLICE and VSLICE lines.

	fixed a problem introduced in the last commit which prevented the
	graphics box (VIS5D_BOX) from being drawn under certain conditions.

	* src/api.c, src/api.h, src/globals.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/gui.c, src/misc.c, src/queue.c, src/render.c, src/work.c:
	 changed shaded contours to plot extreme values for data outside of range
	 rather than missing.  Added support for selecting either colored vertex or
	 texture shaded style of shaded contours.  Texture shaded contours update
	 continuously when changing the colortable while the colored vertex method
	 must recompute the contours.  However the graphics produced are different,
	  and may not be to the liking of some users.  This will be presented as an option in gtk. lui5 will use the colored vertex (original method)

	 Added support for changeing the linestyle of isoline plots, however this needs more work, I think that the way contours are currently drawn (as disjoint lines rather than line strips) precludes this being a usable option.

	 Changed gui.c so that volumes are not recomputed while any mouse button is
	 pressed in the graphics window, they are only recomputed when the mouse is
	 released.  Currently the volume is not drawn, we can also consider redrawing
	 the most recently rendered volume while doing mouse operations.

2001-08-29  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/api.c, src/api.h, src/globals.h, src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/misc.c, src/queue.c, src/render.c, src/work.c:
	added support for selecting either color texture or color technique of
	shaded contours and support for selecting fill style in either mode.

	An api function was added to support selecting fill style
	vis5d_var_graphics_option

	* src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/render.c, src/work.c:
	rather than copying code to generate_ functions, I've modified the
	draw_ functions to handle gllists.  I've also cleaned up the draw_color_quadmesh
	routine and added an option to draw as a texture_method.

	* src/graphics.ogl.c, src/render.c:

	* src/globals.h, src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/gui.c, src/misc.c, src/render.c, src/save.c, src/volume.c, src/work.c:
	fixes a bug introduced in the last commit for isosurfaces and adds chslice and
	cvslice to the graphics which can use glLists.  Problem: changing the color table in a colored slice is no longer a trivial operation and requires recomputing the whole thing...

	I also changed the color table algorythm so that out of bounds values are rendered as the boundary color 0 or 254 rather than 255 (the missing value).

	* src/globals.h, src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/misc.c, src/render.c, src/save.c, src/work.c:
	experimental addition in macro flag USE_GLLISTS:

	horizontal contours are stored in glLists rather than as lists of vectors.
	This turns over memory management for these objects to the ogl library, and
	frees vis5d memory for other uses.  Compiling with this flag will break
	save and restore functions for hslice.  This flag should be considered
	experimental at this time.

	Added 2 new api functions and the underlying code to support them:

	vis5d_set_chslice_limits(int index, int var, float low, float high, float level)
	int vis5d_get_chslice_limits( int index, int var, float *low, float *high, float *level )

	Sets or retreves the chslice including the upper and lower limits of the
	colortable.  Data values outside this range are ploted as missing - transparent black.  setting low>= high results in a set of reasonable limits being chosen for you.

	This commit is a major change in the internal structures of vis5d.  A vis5d_variable structure was introduced and many of the items from the ctx context were moved into it.  On my machine this resulted in the resident memory used by vis5d being reduced from about 48M to 17M.  I suspect there are a few memory leaks and I am unsure as to the functionality of the irregular data - however I feel this change is well worth any shortterm headaches it may cause.

	This commit introduces individual font support for various objects withen the
	graphics window.  In particular the contour label font can now be selected
	and sized.  To use this option you must currently compile with -DUSE_SYSTEM_FONTS
	I find that selecting fonts in this manner makes the contour labels much more readable - currently the font is just written over the contour line.  I will probably modify this so that a box is created around the label.  The box created in countour.c is much too large and doesn't change size with zoom.

	NOTE changes in the API

	vis5d_set_font(int index, char *fontname, int size, Fontlist which)

	is added.

	with USE_SYSTEM_FONTS defined
	int vis5d_get_font_height( int index, int *height )
	is changed to
	int vis5d_get_font_height(int index, int *height, Fontlist which)

	Fontlist is defined in api.h

	* gtk/gtkrc, gtk/main.c:
	I want the graphics window clist background color to match that of the
	graphics window.  I found that the ?best? way to do this was by using a
	gtkrc file.  For now this file is looked for in the source directory
	we will need to move it to share when we are ready to install the gtk version.

	* Makefile.am, autogen.sh, configure.in, gtk/callbacks.c, po/ChangeLog:

	* src/topo.c:
	in looking for the topo header i replaced strcmp with strncmp so that the
	null byte is not required after TOPO or TOPO2 , this also means that the
	order had to be reversed in the if/else if.

	* src/work.c:
	In extract_hslicePRIME the LowLev of the dtx rather than that of the variable
	was being used to extract hslices from a given variable.  This caused variable
	contours to be displayed at levels below which the variables were undefined.

	A similar change was made in extract_hslice in 1998, i can only assume he overlooked the code in extract_hslicePRIME.

	* src/proj.c:
	removed static declarations for lat lon and hgt in several conversion routines
	and replaced with malloc calls.  At least on my linux box this makes a significant improvement in memory usage since in most cases the static value was 64000 or more and the amount actually required was 1.

	* src/api.c, src/api.h, src/globals.h, src/resample_i.c, src/topo.c, src/topo.h:
	improved cleanup of topo structure in free_topo which now takes arg (struct Topo **tptr) and sets *tptr=NULL on exit.

2001-07-17  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/main.c:
	added an option -version which prints the vis5d+ version number and exits.

	* NEWS, convert/foo2_to_v5d.f, src/render.c, src/v5d.c: applied patch
	This fixes several date problems:

	- Year 2000 problem (you can now optionally specify year with 4 digits)
	  ..now gets the weekday right.
	- Year 2100 problem: it is not a leap year.
	- Timestamp comparison was wrong, it would accept date1 < date0
	  if time1 > time0.

	  In the fortran callable V5DSETUNITS units were not stripped of trailing
	white space.  Maybe you can comment on if this is a good fix.

	  I added fortran-callable functions V5DUPDATE and V5DUPDATETIMES,
	as the functionality was available in C also.  I have not tested those
	though.  My idea is to incrementally append to a v5d file as the
	model run creating the data advances, so I can check the early results
	as soon as they are available..

	Hi,

	By taking the topo information out of the monolithic Display_context
	structure and creating a seperate topo structure I was able to call
	the functions in topo.c from resample_i.c and thus could get rid of
	file topo_i.c.  I've removed that file from the Makefile.am and thus
	the library, should also do a cvs remove but will wait a little.

	Jim

	* src/resample_i.c, src/resample_i.h, src/topo_i.c, src/v5dimport.c:
	The topo file used when doing interpolation in v5dimport was hard
	coded to EARTH.topo in the local directory.  I modified it to accept
	environment variables VIS5D_PATH and VIS5D_TOPO and to use the
	DATA_PREFIX defined in ../config.h and EARTH.TOPO otherwise.

	I put these in v5dimport.c so it is probably still broken when run
	from vis5d proper.

	* src/file_i.c:
	Removed an abitrary restriction on the minimum size of a file to be
	imported which caused certain small grads header files to fail to be
	imported.

2001-06-06  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/projlist_i.c:
	Function new_vcs was not correctly handling the lowlev variable when
	importing from a vis5d file.For example, if a vcs had 4 levels 1012
	1000 750 500 and a variable had lowlev=1 Nl=3, that variable should be
	defined on levels 1000 750 and 500, but v5dimport was ignoring the
	lowlev and using levels 1012 1000 and 750.

	* src/read_grads_i.c:
	Treat a grads 2d var with levels specified as 0 as a surface var.

	* src/output_i.c:
	Now prints a warning to stdout when an entire field is written as missing.

	* src/select_i.c:
	modified so that selecting a variable to keep also selects it's projection and vcs.

	* src/read_grads_i.c:

2001-06-01  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/projlist_i.c:
	corrected error message and improved output from list command for vcs when

	* src/read_grads_i.c:
	Fixed a bug introduced in the last commit which caused the first character of
	the data file name to be lost when the grads ctl and data file are both in the
	current directory.  Corrected reading of levels to be unequal_mb (was unequal_heights)
	and replaced pressure to height conversion with the one used by the rest of vis5d.

	* src/ui_i.c:
	fixed bug in 'omit all' option.  Replaced hard coded values for vcs with
	vcs macro values.  corrected info printed for VERT_UNEQUAL_MB.

2001-05-07  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	Poelman.

	* acx_pthread.m4, ChangeLog: updated

2000-11-28  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* configure.in: removed import directory

2000-11-08  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/api.c, src/work.c:
	This change allows vis5d_set_hslice to choose reasonable values based
	on the data to be contoured when the value of interval passed in is
	set to 0.
	TODO: update api document regarding vis5d_set_hslice.

	* src/api.c, src/globals.h, src/render.c:
	Moved variable LabelColor from structure datacontext to label
	structure so that each label may be individually colored.  Default
	color is white as before, label color is changed through the
	vis5d_set_color where number is now the label_id.  vis5d_make_label
	returns the label_id if successful.

	ToDo: The api documentation should be updated.  The make_label should
	probably return an error if the coordinates of the label position are
	outside the clipping plane (in which case it doesn't print)

	* src/file.c, src/iapi.c:
	Relaxed conditions to read fsl netcdf files slightly so that this code can
	also be used to read my SYNOP files of otherwise the same format.  Added an
	ERROR message for the case of trying to open a non-NetCDF file as irregular data.

	* src/v5d.c, util/makemap.c, util/maketopo.c, util/topoinfo.c, configure.in:
	Added missing header files, which caused problems on some systems
	(e.g. Solaris).

	* AUTHORS: added Jim's institution

2000-10-27  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* AUTHORS, ChangeLog: updated

	* src/api.c, src/grid.c, src/main.c, src/v5d.c:
	Please don't leave commented-out source in the code, unless it adds
	to the clarity.  Merely keeping track of the change history is what CVS is for.

2000-10-27  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/api.c, src/api.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/grid.c, src/gui.c, src/main.c, src/render.c, src/topo.c, src/v5d.c:
	This is a continued clean up of the source code which removes a lot of
	unused code and moves lui5 code out of the api interface.  Also a new
	variable and api function has been added, the function is
	vis5d_set_verbose_level and this can be used to set the level of
	stdout verbosity of vis5d.  A number of values have been defined in
	api.h as follows:

	  /*** Verbose Levels ***/
	#define VERBOSE_DATA             1
	#define VERBOSE_DISPLAY          2
	#define VERBOSE_IRREGULAR        4
	#define VERBOSE_REDRAW           8
	#define VERBOSE_OPENGL          16
	#define VERBOSE_RENDER          32
	#define VERBOSE_ALL            2147483648

	these values can be bitwise ored together.  Note that using the
	VERBOSE_REDRAW value can be very noisy as redraw is called several
	times per second as vis5d passes through it's event loop.  Currently
	there is no command line interface to set the verbose level in the
	vis5d program, but there is no reason you couldn't put it there :-)

2000-10-23  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* configure.in, src/analyze_i.c, src/file_i.c, src/gui_i.c, src/misc_i.c, src/misc_i.h, src/read_epa_i.c, src/read_gr3d_i.c, src/read_grads_i.c, src/read_grid_i.c, src/read_uwvis_i.c, src/read_v5d_i.c, src/tokenize_i.c:
	Check for strcasecmp and strncasecmp in configure, and use replacements
	if they're not available.  Also, use the system strdup function instead
	of our own, if it is available.

	* src/graphics.ogl.c: error output goes to stderr

	* ChangeLog, NEWS: updated

	* src/vis5d.h:
	Fixed typo that prevented --with-memory configure option from working.
	Fix submitted by Andrew Woolf.

2000-10-04  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* util/Makefile.am:
	Whoops, automake uses the Fortran linker whenever *any* of the sources
	are in Fortran, which doesn't seem to be the right thing if the main()
	function is in C.  This is remedied by specifically setting the LINK command
	for those programs.

	* configure.in, util/Makefile.am:
	Fixed some problems under Tru64 Unix, reported by Frederic Chagnon.
	First, the grep usage in configure.in is replaced with more portable,
	and cleaner, sh case statements.  Second, the Fortran utilities in
	utils/ need to be linked with the C compiler, apparently.  Also, got
	rid of libmain.a and just linked the object files directly.

2000-09-30  stevengj  <stevengj@ab-initio>

	* doc/chap2.sgml, doc/chap7.sgml, Makefile.am:
	removed now-redundant import/ dir

	* configure.in, src/Makefile.am, util/Makefile.am:
	libvis5dgui is now a static library, and is not installed; there is no
	point since it depends upon liblui, which we don't install.  Also,
	recreated libv5d.la, since otherwise programs that just want to do file I/O
	need to link with X11, OpenGL, etcetera to prevent link errors.  configure.in
	needs to call AM_LIBTOOL, not AC_LIBTOOL.

2000-09-28  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/Makefile.am:
	added libvis5dgui for those who use the api and the lui

	* Makefile.am, configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/api.c, src/api.h, src/box.c, src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/grid.c, src/gui.c, src/main_i.c, src/proj.c, src/read_grid_i.c, src/sounding.c, src/topo.c, src/v5d.c, src/v5d.h, src/work.c, util/Makefile.am, util/fromxwd.c, util/main.c:
	merge of api_exp_branch into main.  Changes include merge of libv5d and libvis5d.
	and exclusion of all gui dependent calls from libvis5d.

	* src/Makefile.am, src/api.c, src/api.h:
	removed the libv5d and moved it's contents to libvis5d.

2000-09-25  poelmanc  <poelmanc@ab-initio>

	* src/proj_i.c:
	Fixed a crasher, added bounds-check to vertical levels interpolation code

	* src/read_grads_i.c:
	Make GrADS keyword comparisons case-insensitive, add support for PDEF statement,
	handle "options template" and "options byteswapped"

	* src/file_i.c: Make test for GrADS files case-insensitive

	* src/misc_i.h:
	Cheezy #defines for WIN32 strcasecmp, should be autoconf-iscated instead!

	* src/Makefile.am:
	Makefile now builds v5dimport right here without needing separate "import"
	directory or any of the code there.

	* src/v5dimport.c: Trivial "main" for v5dimport executable.

	* src/gui.c, src/gui_i.h, src/main_i.c, src/main_i.h:
	Minor mods to pass "standalone" flag to v5dimport code to indicate whether
	runnig from vis5d or from standalone v5dimport executable.

	* src/gui_i.c:
	"IMPORT" GUI code now generalized so it can also be used for the standalone
	v5dimport program, eliminates need for separate "import" directory.

	* src/proj2_i.c:
	Removing completely unused file with no redeeming value

	* src/work.c:
	Better error reporting when can't draw contour lines due to missing or constant
	data (used to give misleading message: "You don't have enough memory to draw
	hslices")

	* src/graphics.ogl.c, src/image.c, src/volume.c, src/gl_to_ppm.c, src/graphics.h:
	Added OpenGL error-checking after all OpenGL commands to more accurately
	identify the source of any OpenGL errors.

	* src/alpha_i.c, src/areal_i.c, src/julian2std_i.c, src/mm4_i.c, src/mm4date2std_i.c, src/model_i.c, src/netcdf2julian_i.c, src/netcdf_i.h, src/radm_emis_i.c, src/radm_i.c, src/rom_i.c, src/uam_i.c:
	These files have never been used, moved into contrib/epa to remove clutter.

	* contrib/epa/Makefile, contrib/epa/README, contrib/epa/alpha.c, contrib/epa/areal.c, contrib/epa/julian2std.c, contrib/epa/mm4.c, contrib/epa/mm4date2std.c, contrib/epa/model.c, contrib/epa/model.h, contrib/epa/netcdf.h, contrib/epa/netcdf2julian.c, contrib/epa/radm.c, contrib/epa/radm_emis.c, contrib/epa/rom.c, contrib/epa/uam.c:
	Removed these unsed files from import and src directories, they are still unused
	but retained here for reference by future generations.

2000-09-21  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/api.c, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/grid.c, src/v5d.c, src/v5d.h:
	modifications to the api for the addition of an external gui

	* src/main_i.c, src/read_grid_i.c, src/sounding.c:
	more changes to get the gui out of the api

	* src/Makefile.am:
	back to just two libraries but rearranged so that linking libvis5d and
	libv5d only give you an (almost) working api.  Exceptions are
	in api.c :
	int vis5d_map_sndwindow( int index)
	int vis5d_unmap_sndwindow( int index )
	seem to be gui functions.

2000-09-18  jedwards  <jedwards@ab-initio>

	* src/work.c, util/main.c, Makefile.am, configure.in, src/Makefile.am, src/api.c, src/api.h, src/box.c, src/graphics.h, src/graphics.ogl.c, src/grid.c, src/proj.c, src/topo.c, src/v5d.c:
	Began the process of seperating the api from the gui.  Modified the
	Makefile.am so that a target API creates a library libvis5dapi.la
	which contains only modules needed by the API.  This library is
	compiled with cpp define APIONLY.  The goal here is to create a new
	API which accesses vis5d functions only through the API, extending the
	API if nessasary to do so.  One aspect of doing this is to seperate calls to
	Xlib functions from the API.

	Also began cleaning up the code by removing declared but unused variables.
