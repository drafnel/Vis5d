<chapter id="ch04"><title>McIDAS 3D Grid Data Files</title>
<para>
     In previous versions of Vis5D, it was standard practice to put
one's data into a McIDAS GR3D file, then compress it with comp5d prior
to using vis5d.
</para>
<para>
     While directly converting to the v5d format is prefered, we still
include this information on the McIDAS format.  If you don't want to
put your data into McIDAS files, you may skip to 
<link linkend="ch05">chapter 5</link> now.
</para>
<para>
<warning>
<para>
We recommend against this way of getting your data into Vis5d.
Instead, use the techniques described in <link linkend="ch03">chapter
3</link>of this manual.

</para>
<para>
     A McIDAS GR3D file contains a sequence of 3-D grids of data.  The
three- dimensional grids are organized into short sequences to
enumerate the values of multiple physical variables at a single time.
The short sequences of physical variables are repeated into a longer
sequence which steps through many time steps.  These files have a
names of the form GR3Dnnnn where nnnn is a 4-digit number between 0001
and 9999.  The McIDAS utility programs then refer to files only by a
number (1 through 9999).
</para>
<para>
     A 3D grid file contains a directory entry for each 3D grid, which
describes the size and geographic location of the grid, and the date,
time and name of physical variable of the data in the grid array.  A
five-dimensional data set consists of a sequence of 3D grids in a 3D
grid file, all with the same size and geographic locations.  The grid
sequence repeats the same short sequence of physical variables
stepping forward through time.  For example, the grid sequence from a
weather model could be:

     Vis5D allows data sets which span more than one 3D grid file.  In
this case the grid sequence of repeating variables and repeating time
steps continues across grid file boundaries.  A single 3D grid file is
limited to 100,000,000 grid points (400 megabytes).  If your data set
contains more than this number of grid points, then you should alter
<filename>sample.F</filename> to create a new 3D grid file (by incrementing IGRIDF and
calling IGMK3D) on every Nth time step, where N time steps will fit in
one 3D grid file.  Note that the comp5d command described in 
<link linkend="ch05">chapter 5</link>
references data sets as sequences of 3D grid files.
</para>
<para>
     The Vis5D system processes the gridded data based on the
information in the grid directories, which is contained in the IDIR
array in the sample.F program. It is a good idea to initialize IDIR to
all zeros, as in line 40.  The size of the 3D grid is set in entries 1
to 4 of IDIR (lines 72 to 75).  Note the restrictions on data set size
described in <link linkend="ch04sec2">section 4.2</link> of this document.
</para>
<para>
     The date and time of the 3D grid are set in entries 6 and 7 of
IDIR, as in lines 97 and 99.  Note that they are represented in our
YYDDD and HHMMSS formats described above.  Four functions are
available in 
<filename>libmain.a</filename>
 for converting between these formats and a
format which makes date and time calculations easy. The IDAYS function
converts YYDDD format to days since January 1, 1900, as in line 60.
The ISECS function converts HHMMSS format to seconds since midnight,
as in lines 62 and 125.  This makes it easy to do calculations with
dates and times, as in lines 125, 127 and 128.  Then the IYYDDD
function converts days back to YYDDD and the IHMS function converts
back to HHMMSS, as in lines 97 amd 99.
</para>
<para>
 The physical variable name is 4 ASCII characters packed into entry 9 of
IDIR, as in line 105.  The LIT function in 
<filename>libmain.a</filename> converts a CHARACTER*4 to an INTEGER*4.
</para>
<para>
The spatial location of the grid is described in terms of latitude and
longitude in ten-thousandths of a degree, and in terms of height 
(altitude) in meters.  
The grid element G(1,1,1) is in the north west bottom corner of the
grid, and the grid element G(NLATS,NLONS,NHGTS) is in the south east 
top corner.
The grid latitude and longitude are described in entries 21 to 25 
of IDIR, as in lines 78 to 82.  
The grid heights are described in entries 31 to 33, as in lines
85 to 87.  
The NINT function is a FORTRAN intrinsic for converting a REAL to the
nearest INTEGER.  The latitude, longitude and height spacings are 
simply the distances between between successive grid points.  
Latitudes are positive in the northern hemisphere, longitudes are 
positive in the western hemispere, and of course heights are 
positive above sea level.
</para>
<para>
     The real work in modifying the <filename>sample.F</filename>
 program is writing code for getting your data into the G array, in lines 107 to 113.  
For some data you may want to fake the latitude, longitude and height coordinates.  
However, if your data is geographical and large scale, then you may want to describe 
its location accurately, and it may be necessary to resample your data to a regularly 
spaced grid in latitude, longitude and height from some other map projection.  It may
also be necessary to transpose your data array to get the index order to be LAT,
LON and HGT, and to invert your data array in some index to make sure G(1,1,1)
is the north west bottom corner.  Even in faked coordinates, you may need to
transpose or invert your data array to get the right 'handedness' in the
display.  The Vis5D system allows grid points marked as missing, indicated by
array values greater than 1.0E30.  If you do fake the latitude, longitude and
height coordinates, then the topography and map display of the vis5d program
will be meaningless.  If you calculate trajectories for your data set, either
use accurate coordinates, or take great care to get relative time, distance and
velocity scales consistent in the faked coordinates.  Otherwaise trajectory
paths will not be realistic.

<para>
     The IPP function in 
<filename>libmain.a</filename> 
returns the value of a command parameter as
INTEGER*4, as in line 45.  There are similar functions CPP and 
DPP in libmain.a
which return CHARACTER*12 (converted to upper case) and REAL*8 values for
command parameters.  They get command parameters based on their sequential
position in the command line.  They all have similar function parameters:

There is also a mechanism for picking up command parameters based on keywords.
This is done with the functions IKWP, CKWP and DKWP in libmain.a.  They get
command parameters based on position after a keyword of the form 
<parameter>-keyword</parameter>.
IKWP returns an INTEGER*4, CKWP returns a CHARACTER*12

     On the most machines the REAL*4 format is not a subset of the REAL*8
format, so make sure to declare DPP and DKWP as REAL*8, as well as their third
function parameters (for default values of command parameters).

     There are restrictions on the dimensions of data sets which can be

64MB system, the limit is around 25,000,000, with performance degrading as the
data set size exceedes the limit.

     Vis5D provides the gg3d and igg3d programs which can be used to reduce the
resolution and scale of a data set to meet these limits.  The gg3d program
resamples a 3D grid to new array dimensions and new extents in latitude,
longitude and height, using the command:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
     gg3d samp N I M J
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
     gg3d ave  N I M J
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>     
where N and I are the numbers of the source 3D grid file and grid, and M and J
are the numbers of the destination 3D grid file and grid.  The 'samp' version
calculates destination grid point values by linearly interpolating between
source grid point values, and is appropriate for increasing resolution.  The
'ave' version calculates destination grid points by averaging multiple source
grid point values, and is appropriate for decreasing resolution.  Without any
keywords gg3d will do a straight copy operation.  Invoke the gg3d command with
the keyword:
</para>
<para>
     <parameter>-size NLATS NLONS NHGTS</parameter>
</para>
<para>
to set the grid dimensions for the destination grid as different from the
dimensions for the source grid.  Invoke gg3d with the keywords:
</para>

to set extents (range bounds) for the latitude, longitude and height for the

<para>
     The igg3d program provides options for copying and deleting 3D grids and
for interpolating between 3D grids in time.  Sequences of 3D grids are copied
using the command:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
     igg3d get N I J M K
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
where N is the source 3D grid file number, I and J are the range of source grid
numbers, M is the destination grid file number, and K is the starting
destination grid number.  A single grid may be copied within a 3D grid file
using the command:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>
     igg3d copy I J -gr3df N
</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
where N is the 3D grid file number, I is the number of the source grid and J is
the number of the destination grid.  A range of grids may be deleted with the
command:
</para>
<para>
  <programlisting> igg3d del I J -gr3df N</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
where N is the 3D grid file number and grid numbers between I and J are to be
deleted.
</para>
<para>
The igg3d command provides two different options for time interpolation.  The
first is:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting> igg3d ave K I J D T -gr3df N</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
where grid number K is produced by interpolating between grid numbers I and J,
all in 3D grid file number N.  Grid number K will be assigned day D (in YYDDD
format) and time T (in HHMMSS format).  The relative weighting of grids I and J
is calculated from this date and time, assuming linear time interpolation.  If
grid K is not between grids I and J in date and time, igg3d prints an error
message.  The igg3d command also provides a more complex time interpolation
option:
</para>
<para>
    <programlisting>igg3d int I D T -setdel S M -lag U V -gr3df N</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
     This will put a grid in the next empty slot of 3D grid file number N,
assigned to day D (in YYDDD format) and time T (in HHMMSS format).  This grid
will be interpolated from a sequence of grids, all in file number N, at grid
numbers I, I+S, I+2S, ... , I+(M-1)S.  This sequence of grids should be
ascending in date and time.  igg3d will search the sequence and linearly
interpolate between the two consectutive grids from the sequence which bracket
day D and time T.  Furthermore, the interpolation will be done in a coordinate
system moving at constant velocity (U, V), where U and V are in meters per
second, with V positive for motion from south to north and U positive for motion
from west to east.  The two bracketing grids from the sequence will be shifted
in latitude and longitude to their positions at day D and time T, and the result
interpolated between these two spatially shifted grids.  Furthermore, if the
grids in the sequence are identified in their directory entries with variable
name 'U   ' or 'V   ', then the corresponding component of the velocity (U, V)
will be subtracted from the grid values.
</para>
<para>
     The 'int' option of igg3d may seem complex, but it is just what you need if
you want to write a script to re-interpolate a five-dimensional data set to a
new sequence of time steps.  It is particularly useful if the source sequence
does not have uniform time steps, or if the physics are moving through the
spatial grid and you want to avoid blurring in the time re-interpolation.  You
would set M equal to the number of time steps and S equal to the number of
physical variables in the source five-dimensional data set.  The I parameter
would be set equal to the grid number in the first time step of the variable
being interpolated.  Note that this igg3d option will put the new grid at the
end of the grid file containing the source data set, but you can use 'igg3d get'
to move it to another grid.
</para>
<para>
You can use the command:
</para>
<para>
<programlisting>igu3d make N M</programlisting>
</para>
<para>
to create 3D grid file number N, which allows 3D grids of up to M points each.
The names of 3D grid files have the form:
<filename>GR3Dnnnn</filename>,
where <filename>nnnn</filename> is the four digit decimal grid file number, padded with leading zeros
if needed to make four digits.
