<title>OVERVIEW OF Vis5D</title>
<para>
      Vis5D is a software system that can be used to visualize both
gridded data and irregularly located data.  Sources for this data can
come from numerical weather models, surface observations and other
similar sources.  Vis5D can work on data in the form of a
five-dimensional rectangle.  That is, the data are real numbers at
each point of a "grid" which spans three space dimensions, one time
dimension and a dimension for enumerating multiple physical variables.
Of course, Vis5D works perfectly well on data sets with only one
variable, one time step (i.e. no time dynamics) or one vertical level.
However, your data grids should have at least two rows and columns.
Vis5D can also work with irregularly spaced data which are stored as
"records".  Each record contains a geographic location, a time, and a
set of variables which can contain either character or numerical data.

      A major feature of Vis5D is support for comparing multiple data
sets.  This extra data can be incorporated at run-time as a list of
*.v5d files or imported at anytime after Vis5D is running. Data can be
overlaid in the same 3-D display and/or viewed side-by-side spread
sheet style.  Data sets that are overlaid are aligned in space and
time.  In the spread sheet style, multiple displays can be linked.
Once linked, the time steps from all data sets are merged and the
controls of the linked displays are synchronized.

<para>
      The Vis5D system includes the vis5d visualization program,
several programs for managing and analyzing five-dimensional data
grids, and instructions and sample source code for converting your
data into its file format.  We have included the Vis5D source code so
you can modify it or write new programs. You can download the sample
data sets from the LAMPS model and from Bob Schlesinger's thunderstorm
model, so you can work through our examples.  (We have also included a
small dataset, hole.v5d, so you can verify that Vis5D works and try a
couple of simple plots.)

      Vis5D version 1.0 was written by Bill Hibbard and Dave Santek of
the University of Wisconsin Space Science and Engineering Center,
supported by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, and by
Marie-Francoise Voidrot-Martinez of the French Meteorology Office.
Later version enhancements were written by Bill Hibbard, Brian Paul,
Johan Kellum, and Andre Battaiola. Dave Kamins and Jeff Vroom of
Stellar Computer, Inc. provided substantial help and advice in using
the Stellar software libraries.  Simon Baas and Hans de Jong of the
Netherlands ported Vis5D to HP workstations.  Pratish Shah of Kubota
Inc. ported Vis5D to the Kubota Alpha/Denali workstation.  Mike
Stroyan of Hewlett Packard added PEX support.  Steven G. Johnson of
MIT added autoconf/automake support.
