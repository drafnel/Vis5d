This directory contains files that were formerly in the vis5d-5.2/import
directory but were not being used at all, with the exception of model.h.
(Nearly identical copies of these files existed in the vis5d-5.2/src directory,
but with "_i" added to all of the file names. They were unused there also.) The
Makefile implied that they had been received from the EPA, so perhaps they had
been used for "inspiration" in constructing the EPA file import capability
of v5dimport. They are being saved here for posterity but they do not compile
into a useful executable of any sort as far as I can tell.
