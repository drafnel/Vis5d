This is Vis5d+, a free volumetric rendering program based on Vis5d.
You can find out more about Vis5d+ at the web page:

		http://vis5d.sourceforge.net/

Please see the doc/ subdirectory for more information on Vis5d+,
including installation instructions, in both PDF and HTML formats.
For the lazy, a typical installation is simply:

		./configure
		make
		su -c 'make install'


NOTES ON THE GTK INTERFACE:

The gtk user interface is incomplete and should only be built by those
interested in contributing to it's development.  The gtk interface and
it's files, with the exception of the i18n language files, do not
install on a make install.

gtk/gradient data files are in the format used by gimp (www.gimp.org).
On my machine they are located in directory
/usr/share/gimp/1.2/gradients vis5d+ expects them in
$(toplevel)/gtk/gradients/data, a link will work.  gimp includes a
very nice gradient editing tool to create new gradient files.  We do
not yet have a set of gradient files specific to vis5d+, however if
you would like to contribute any ...
